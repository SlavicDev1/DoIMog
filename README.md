Do I Mog? 

This website was made as a project during the meteroic rise od looksmaxxing online. 
I made is using html, css and javascript, it's relatively basic but as one of my first web project I'd say it looks pretty alright!

The "moving parts" of the website are pretty elementary, basically just a panel with sliders where the user inputs their stats and it displays a comic "you MOG" or "It's over" depending on how rare that user is in the world population.
The whole thing can maybe make some people upset but weather or not they wish to believe that has negative impact on their life is on them, I simply made a little fun website.
Another thing that can change is on the "How do I mog" page where it challanges you to do some pushups, this is a fun little interactive challange for the user that can maybe push them to be healthier.

You can access the website for yourself here: https://petardeveloper.github.io/DoIMog/index.html
