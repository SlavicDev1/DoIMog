    <h1>How does this work?</h1>
    <div id="paragraph1">
        <pre>Well it's pretty simple, all you have to do is enter your stats
with the sliders and the website will compare your stats to the average and give
you the appropriate results. 

Think of it as an IQ test, where 100 is the average score.
If you score 130iq on the test, that would make you 2 standard deviations from the norm
and that would put you in the 96.96th percentile in the human population where average 
is 100. 

Everything I did here works in a simmilar way, where I took the averages for things like
height which is equal to 171cm(5'7) around the globe and I compare it to the entered value,
each value is adjusted to be at least 90% correct.

This was made for men but if you wish for me to create a female version, dm me on any of the 
social media at the bottom of the page (Instagram is the most active though).        </pre>
